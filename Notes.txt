TestCafe
    - https://www.devexpress.com/products/testcafestudio/ (not open source)
    - TestCafe is a free and opensource NodeJS tool to automate e2e testing
        - It runs on Windows, macOS and Linux
    - It supports desktop, mobile, remote and cloud browsers
        - These can also be headless
        - Tests can also be ran in Javascript or Typescript
    - It is an alternative to other testing and automation solutions
    - It is easy to install with one command
    - It is a unique technology
        - It does not control the browser like Puppeteer/Webdriver
        - It is not a browser itself unlike cypress
    - The core is a proxy server which tansforms JS/HTML code to include automation code
    - There are several reasons to use TestCafe
        - Not having to worry about waiting for an element to load
        - Parallel testing in multiple browsers is simple
        - Supports BDD, data driven testing and Page Object Model
        - It is compatible with CI tools

End to End testing
    - This is also known as E2E testing
    - This is a technique to test whether an application flows from start to finish behaves as expected
    - These tests simulate real world user scenarios essentially testing an app how a real user would use the application
    - The purpose of performing E2E tests is to identify dependencies and to ensure data integrity is maintained between systems
    - The benefits of E2E testing are
        - Verification that the entire system is working properly
        - Prevention of bugs or regression issues
    - There are a few different components of TestCafe
        - Client-server
            - There is no external driver needed in TestCafe
            - This allows for cross browser and multi-platform testing
            - TestCafe uses a url rewriting proxy instead of WebDriver
            - This injects the driver script that emulates user actions into a test page
            - TestCafe uses 10.0.75.1 when testing
            - There are reasons for using a server in TestCafe
                - A database or web service can be launched from the tests
                - Access can be gotten to the server file system to read data samples or check uploads
                - Tests can make use of all Node.js features and external modules
                - Tests became faster and more stable as test logic is now separated from the automation scripts
                - Test code can't interrupt the page execution, because TestCafe doesn't inject user-written code
                - The latest syntax features like async/await are supported also with TestCafe
        - TestCafe API
            - Test code uses TestCafe API methods to interact with the tested page
            - There are 3 main types of interaction
                - Select Elements
                - Perform actions
                - Execute assertions
        - Page Proxying
        - Isolated Tests
            - TestCafe isolates each test run from subsequent tests and tests that run in parallel.
            - After a test is completed, TestCafe resets the browser state by
                - Deleting cookies
                - Clearing both local and session storage
                - Reloading the test page
    - TestCafe Studio vs Open-source TestCafe
        - TestCafe Studio is a cross-platform IDE for end-to-end testing or end-to-end web testing
        - It is also multi platform and works in every browser including mobile
        - It has a lot of features such as
            - Visual test recorder, Cross-browser testing and Comprehensive reports with powerful code editor

Install TestCafe
    - Needs to have NodeJS installed
    - VS is used but can be any text editor
    - To check npm version for installing packages
        - Enter the following command npm -v
    - Install the testcafe extensions available on the VSCode marketplace
    - Install the testcafe npm packages

TestCafe Example
    - Initial test examples will use the TestCafe demo site
    - This will be replaced by a more real world example later
    - It is important for testers to understand async\await in Javascript
        - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/async-await-javascript-tutorial/
    - Async\Await is used by TestCafe in all cases
    - TestCafe tests must be organised into categories that are called fixtures
        - A JS/TS file with TestCafe tests can contain 1 or more fixtures
        - To declare a fixture simply use the fixture function
            - fixture 'Authentication Tests' .page 'url'
        - To create a test call the test function a pass a function which contains the test code
            - The test code function accepts the test controller objectas a parameter
                  fixture 'MyFixture';
                  test('Test1', async t => {
                    // Test 1 Code
                })
                  test('Test2', async t => {
                    // Test 2 Code
                })
